The UAS system is vulnerable to three types of attacks: hardware attacks, wireless attacks and sensor spoofing. 

Hardware attacks includes attacks where man-in-the-middle (MitM) directly attacks the components of the UAV, such as physically hijacking the UAV. Wireless attacks are when the attacker intercepts, modifies, fabricates identity or denies of service (DoS) the communicate links or nodes. Sensor spoofing is when attackers interrupt the UAVâ€™s on-board sensor data.



The team enhanced the security of its system by adding multiple layers of protection to prevent threats from different aspects. Table 2 illustrates four major security threats with their severity level identified (1 being the highest) within the current system design and solutions the team has implemented. The main focus has been to address Wireless attacks. See table 2.
