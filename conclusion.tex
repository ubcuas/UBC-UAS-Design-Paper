\section{Conclusion}
UBC Unmanned Aircraft Systems has dedicated a large number of hours developing a robust mission worthy system for AUVSI-SUAS 2019. The approach of defining the main mission requirements early in the year allowed for clear goals and quick design iterations. Not only did this open up more time for extensive testing, but also for modifying the system to be more secure and customized as demanded by the mission.
