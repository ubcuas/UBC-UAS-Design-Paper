\section{Developmental Risks and Mitigation}
\label{sec3:risk}
UBC UAS recognizes that many risks are associated with the operation of unmanned aircraft. The following sections detail serious developmental and mission risks, and the reduced risks following mitigation strategies. The likelihood of occurrence and seriousness is rated from 1 - 5, with 1 being unlikely or minor. Tables 5 and 6 outline the risks and mitigation.
