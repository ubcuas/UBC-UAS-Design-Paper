In this year's competition vehicle the team opted to use the Pixhawk 2. This flight controller will be replacing the Pixhawk 2.4.8 by 3DR. This flight controller was chosen not only for its triple redundant IMU system, but also since it has more ports, better connectors and an internal IMU damping system. The Pixhawk 2 has interface supports for all the sensors and actuators that are used in the system, as well as the telemetry radio. 

The team is using Ardupilot as its flight controller software. It was chosen due to its community support on forums and its code base reliability. Even though Ardupilot is a open source program, the development team conducted flight testing on each of their new releases. Ardupilot provides precise waypoint navigation, autonomous takeoff, and autonomous landing: the waypoint navigation feature will help object avoidance, task rescheduling and altering the mission route. The team can also avoid pilot takeover penalties from autonomous landing/takeoff.
